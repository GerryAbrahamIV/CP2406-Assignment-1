Begin game!

Player gets 8 cards from deck, all unique and randomized
Rest of the cards are inside a deck

Player can see and choose whatever card they have in hand
Then they set the trump type

Moving onto next player
Next player will have to put a card with a higher value on the trump category
If they dont, they can skip, +1 card in hand by taking from the deck.
If they skip, they cannot play for the turn being.

If someone puts a SUPERTRUMP card:
--and if it's Geophysicist and Magnetide, they win the hand
-Change the trump type
-Everyone who's *dead* is alive again

Round ends when everyone is dead but one person

The one person gets to start the next turn

If someone's card is 0, they won and is removed from the game
Game ends until everyone but 1 person have all card from hand removed
OR if someone tries to draw a card but deck is empty.
